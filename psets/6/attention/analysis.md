# Analysis

## Layer 1, Head 3

In this layer and head, I noticed that the model pays attention to the realationship between the words 'what is'. I think it probably pays attention to the word followed by 'what', so i feed it the phrase 'what does [MASK] means' to confirm. And yes, there is a relation between those two

Example Sentences:
- what is the best [MASK] in games
- what does [MASK] means

## Layer 1, Head 11

I noticed that there is a relationship between all words in the sentence and the pronoun 

Example Sentences:
- I like to [MASK] everyday
- He takes [MASK] monthly
